"The CMS, along with its various components, is **completely open-source**"
" and developed on the [WMO RAF GitHub account](https://github.com/orgs"
"/wmo-raf). This implies that the institution will have **unrestricted "
"access to the source code**, allowing them to identify and report any "

#: ../../_docs/Frequently-Asked-Questions.md:9
msgid ""
"The **NMHS installing the CMS and its components will be fully "

"In cases where an NMHS already has an existing website but is interested "
"in testing the new CMS, they have the option to install and run it "
"**concurrently with their existing system** for a specific duration. This"
" allows them to thoroughly evaluate and experience the functionalities "
"offered by the new CMS. Once the NMHS is satisfied and comfortable with "
"the new CMS, a phased approach can be adopted to gradually transition and"

"A fundamental aspect considered during the design and development phase "

"The CMS, which is being built using open-source technologies, benefits "
"from the advantage of having a community of developers who actively "
"contribute to enhancing its security and stability. Furthermore, the CMS "
"offers robust **support for secure authentication mechanisms**, including"
" username/password authentication, integration with third-party "
"authentication systems such as OAuth, and the ability to implement custom"
" authentication backends. Additionally, the CMS performs **regular "
"backups to safeguard the website's data** and enable its restoration in "
"case of data loss. The NMHS are encouraged to share **only the final "
