"The CMS, along with its various components, is **completely open-source**"
" and developed on the [WMO RAF GitHub account](https://github.com/orgs"
"/wmo-raf). This implies that the institution will have **unrestricted "
"access to the source code**, allowing them to identify and report any "
"bugs, request new features, and even actively contribute to the "
"development of the codebase. This open approach encourages collaboration "
"and fosters a sense of ownership and involvement within the institution."

"**concurrently with their existing system** for a specific duration. This"

"offered by the new CMS. Once the NMHS is satisfied and comfortable with "
"the new CMS, a phased approach can be adopted to gradually transition and"
" fully migrate their website to the new CMS. This ensures a smooth and "
"well-managed transition process."

"A fundamental aspect considered during the design and development phase "

"content and page structure. This involved creating a **user-friendly "
"interface with a modern design and intuitive features,** aimed at "
"providing users with a seamless and enjoyable experience. The objective "
"was to enable users to easily locate content and utilize the CMS "
"**without the need for specialized IT skills**."

"The CMS, which is being built using open-source technologies, benefits "
"from the advantage of having a community of developers who actively "

"offers robust **support for secure authentication mechanisms**, including"
" username/password authentication, integration with third-party "
"authentication systems such as OAuth, and the ability to implement custom"
" authentication backends. Additionally, the CMS performs **regular "
"backups to safeguard the website's data** and enable its restoration in "
"case of data loss. The NMHS are encouraged to share **only the final "
"products** intended for the public."

"The **NMHSs independently manage all components of the CMS in a "

"administrative role (superuser) that possesses complete privileges to "

"and roles can be found at (https://github.com/wmo-raf/nmhs-cms/wiki"
"/Manage-Users-and-Roles). It is important to note that WMO RAF does not "
"have involvement in managing the CMS, as its administration and control "
"lie solely with the NMHSs. While WMO RAF does not directly manage the "
"CMS, it does offer valuable support to NMHSs by **providing training and "
"guidance** on the proper management of the CMS. WMO's role is to assist "
"NMHSs in acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively "
"handle and maintain the CMS. This training and guidance aim to empower "
"NMHSs in utilizing the CMS to its full potential and ensuring optimal "
"performance and functionality."
