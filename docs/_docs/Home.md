# Introduction

![CMS Kit](../_static/images/home/cms_package_kit.jpg "CMS Kit")

The **template Content Management System** is available for any NMHS wishing to upgrade its website. This initiative was developed as part of targeted support for African NMHSs in their digital transformation journey. The template was presented to technical experts from NMHSs during a [training in early warning communications](https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/meteoworld/building-capacity-africa-achieve-early-warnings-all).

![Stepwise Approach](../_static/images/home/stepwise_approach.jpg "Stepwise Approach")

This new template offers:
- a customisable and modern design
- seamless marketing integrations
- a user-friendly CAP editor
- advanced climate data visualization tools for any NMHS seeking to upgrade its website. 

It adopts **best practices in data visualization and hydro meteorological department and climate communications**. All components of the website are built on free and open-source standards allowing for collaboration and contribution.

The CAP editor is expected to **increase the adoption of the Common Alerting Protocol in Africa**, key to increasing the reach of alerts, and their connectivity to broadcast, web and mobile networks. Africa remains one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change and increasing extremes. Increasing the protection of the population through improved climate and early warning communications is crucial.

It factored in:
- Well **defined content structure** and pages management, 
- **User-friendly interface** with a modern look and feel

## Delivery and support

For a smooth and efficient delivery of the CMS and customization of the website template to the NMHS, a step by step process will be adopted. The quality and interactivity of the website is first assessed followed by approaching and presenting the CMS and integrating feedback. Thereafter, willing/potential members for support are identified together with a focal point for coordination. The CMS is then installed and training on the configuration of CMS and customization of the website conducted. Additionally, learning materials, documentations and guides are provided alongside follow-up support in troubleshooting
